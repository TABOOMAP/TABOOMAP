The living room lights were dim, and a small table held a framed photo and flowers.\n\nWhen the leader began the prayers, Ricardo sat with his hands together and stayed quiet. He followed when others stood and sat, and he passed the booklet along when it reached him.\n\nAfterward, outside on the sidewalk, he pulled his phone out and typed quickly. A message thread with two friends from the neighborhood popped up.\n\nRicardo wrote, “Acabé en un rosario larguísimo. Pura repetidera, parecían en piloto automático.”\n\nOne friend replied with a laughing emoji. Ricardo continued, “Y todos con ese librito como si fuera libreto de teatro. Qué cosa.”\n\nBehind him, the front door opened and his friend Julián stepped out carrying a tray of leftover pastries. “Ricardo, ¿me ayudas a llevar esto al carro?” Julián asked.\n\nRicardo locked his screen and slid the phone into his pocket. “Sí, de una,” he said.\n\nHe walked back inside, took the tray with both hands, and followed Julián toward the parking area as the family members gathered dishes behind them."

        "story": "Esteban met his friend Carolina at a café in Bucaramanga after work, and they sat by the window with two tintos. Carolina scrolled through her phone and said, “Did you see the article about reforms?”\n\nEsteban nodded. “Yeah,” he said, pulling his own phone out. “From what I read, the proposal affects funding and how services are managed, but it’s still being debated in Congress.”\n\nCarolina frowned. “People online are saying it will fix everything.”\n\nEsteban shook his head slightly. “I don’t think any single policy does that,” he said. “There are tradeoffs. Some groups benefit, others might face delays or higher costs, depending on how it’s implemented.”\n\nCarolina asked, “So what’s the issue?”\n\nEsteban tapped the screen and read a few lines quietly, then summarized. “The disagreement seems to be about oversight and who holds contracts,” he said. “And there’s also the question of how rural areas are covered, because logistics are different outside the cities.”\n\nCarolina nodded and asked where he was getting his information.\n\n“Mostly official statements and reporting from a couple of outlets,” Esteban said. “If you want, we can compare sources and see what they agree on.”\n\nCarolina handed him her phone, and Esteban leaned over it, scrolling through the article while the waiter refilled their water glasses."

        "story": "Patricia attended a small dinner in Bogotá with coworkers from different departments. The conversation drifted to public services and recent complaints about delays.\n\nPatricia dabbed her mouth with a napkin and said, “I completely understand it’s complicated here,” keeping her voice gentle. “It’s just that in more organized places, systems run on time, so it can be surprising.”\n\nA coworker, Andrés, lifted his eyebrows. “Like where?”\n\nPatricia smiled. “Oh, lots of places,” she said. “I’m not comparing in a bad way. I’m just saying there’s a different level of civic discipline.”\n\nAndrés set his fork down. “People work hard here too,” he said.\n\nPatricia nodded quickly. “Of course, of course,” she replied. “I’m sure individuals do. It’s more the culture of following rules. If people could just be more responsible, things would improve.”\n\nSomeone across the table reached for the salt, and the chair legs scraped lightly.\n\nPatricia continued in the same calm tone. “I say it with respect,” she said. “It’s just something to learn from countries that have it figured out.”\n\nAndrés looked toward the kitchen. Another coworker changed the subject to weekend plans.\n\nPatricia picked up her glass and took a small sip, then adjusted the place setting in front of her as the conversation moved on."

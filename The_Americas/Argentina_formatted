Lucía needed to reach the spice stand behind them before her friend arrived.\n\nShe slowed, angled her shoulders, and leaned in just enough to be heard. “Permiso,” she said, keeping her eyes on the gap between their elbows. One of the tourists shifted a step to the left without turning fully, and the vendor lifted his hand slightly, pausing his sentence.\n\nLucía slipped between them in two quick steps, keeping her tote close so it didn’t swing. “Gracias,” she added over her shoulder as she cleared the space. The vendor resumed, “Mirá, acá está la costura…,” and the tourists leaned back toward the table.\n\nLucía exhaled, scanned the jars of ají molido and oregano, and tapped the counter. “¿Tenés comino en grano?” she asked, setting a coin purse down on the wood."

The other paused with his mouth open, then looked down at the drip marks.\n\nFederico kept moving and spoke into his phone as if nothing had changed. “Sí, sí, ya estoy subiendo,” he said, turning his back to them. Behind him, the two coworkers fell silent for a moment, then one of them said, “Bueno, como te decía…,” and they shifted to the side.\n\nFederico pressed the elevator button twice, stared at the floor indicator, and wiped his cup lid with a napkin from his pocket."

He was going to his building manager’s small retirement gathering, and he’d seen neighbors whispering about “getting something big.”\n\nHe picked up a pricey bottle behind glass, then set it back on the shelf. Instead, he walked to a display of modest items: a simple plant in a ceramic pot and a small box of alfajores from a local brand. He chose the plant and the alfajores, both with clear prices on the tags that didn’t make the cashier raise an eyebrow.\n\nAt home, he put them in a plain bag and added a short card: “Gracias por estos años.”\n\nIn the lobby that evening, a few residents gathered near the mailboxes. The manager, Don Roberto, wore his usual jacket and held a paper cup of soda.\n\nAgustín stepped forward. “Roberto, congrats,” he said, handing over the bag.\n\nRoberto looked inside and chuckled. “A plant! My wife will like this.”\n\n“Y unos alfajorcitos,” Agustín said, nodding.\n\nRoberto squeezed his shoulder. “Gracias, pibe.”\n\nAgustín stepped back as another neighbor moved in with a gift, and Roberto set the bag on the table by the intercom."

        "story": "Joaquín sat at a family gathering in Lanús while his girlfriend’s uncles argued softly near the grill. Someone mentioned Perón in passing, and Joaquín lifted his hands.\n\n“Nah, I’m not getting into politics,” he said, looking down at his plate.\n\nAn uncle laughed. “Better that way.”\n\nA few minutes later, the conversation drifted to Malvinas because a documentary was on TV. Joaquín kept his face calm and said, “It’s a sensitive topic, sure.”\n\nThe uncle nodded. “Exactly.”\n\nJoaquín took a sip of beer, then added casually, “Some people cling to old stories because it’s easier than dealing with today.”\n\nThe uncle’s eyes narrowed. “What do you mean by that?”\n\nJoaquín shrugged, palms up. “Nothing, nothing. Just an observation,” he said, but he kept talking. “I’m not saying anyone here, of course. Just… you know how people get.”\n\nAcross the table, someone stopped chewing and looked over.\n\nThe uncle leaned forward. “If you’re going to say something, say it.”\n\nJoaquín smiled thinly. “No, no, I said I don’t debate,” he replied, then glanced at the TV and said, “It’s just interesting what people choose to remember.”\n\nThe uncle set his fork down, and Joaquín reached for a piece of bread, tearing it slowly while the table went quiet for a moment."

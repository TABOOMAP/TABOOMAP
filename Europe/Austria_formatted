        "story": "Andreas took the tram across Vienna after work and stopped at a bakery near the stop, where the display case held Topfengolatschen and Apfelstrudel. He pointed and said, “Two of those, please,” and added a small bag of mixed rolls. At his parents’ building, he rang the bell and heard his mother’s footsteps on the stairs. When she opened the door, Andreas held up the paper bag. “I brought something from the Bäckerei,” he said, stepping inside and taking off his shoes. His father looked up from the newspaper and said, “Ah, what’s that?” Andreas set the bag on the kitchen counter and pulled out the pastries on a plate. “For coffee,” he said. His mother reached for plates and asked, “How was your day?” Andreas washed his hands at the sink and then cut the strudel into smaller pieces. He poured water into the kettle and put it on the stove without being asked. When his father came into the kitchen, Andreas slid a pastry toward him and said, “Here, try this one,” and his father picked it up and took a bite while Andreas set out three cups."

Nina opened the fridge door and frowned. “There’s nothing to eat. Why don’t you ever have anything ready?” Her father came in from the garden with muddy gloves. Nina turned toward him. “Dad, my car is making a weird noise. You need to look at it today.” Her father said, “We can after coffee,” and Nina replied, “No, now. I drove all the way here.” She sat down and tapped her fingernails against the table. “Also, I need you to print something for me. Your printer works, mine doesn’t.” Her mother set the knife down and said, “We planned to visit Aunt Elke in an hour.” Nina waved a hand. “You can go later. I’m here.” When her mother offered a slice of bread, Nina pushed it away. “Not that. Make something proper,” she said, and stared at her phone while her parents moved around the kitchen."

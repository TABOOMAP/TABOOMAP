The conversation drifted from weekend plans to news headlines, and someone mentioned Cyprus politics.\n\nHanna didn’t jump in. She set her cup down and looked at the person speaking. When there was a pause, she asked, “Can you help me understand what people mean when they talk about this issue?”\n\nA coworker, Andreas, nodded and started explaining how it came up in local discussions. Hanna listened with her hands folded, eyes on him. She asked, “Is that something you see debated mostly in parliament, or also in neighborhoods?”\n\nAnother coworker added their perspective. Hanna said, “I haven’t lived here long, so I’m missing a lot of context,” and then asked, “What do you think matters most to people day-to-day?”\n\nThey spoke for a few minutes, sometimes talking over each other, then taking turns again. Hanna didn’t interrupt; she waited for a sentence to finish and asked, “When did that change happen?”\n\nWhen someone asked her directly, “And you, Hanna?” she replied, “I’m still learning, so I’d rather hear how you see it,” and nodded for them to continue.\n\nThe waiter came by, and Hanna moved her empty cup to the edge of the table so he could collect it."

This is simple. People here are too emotional about it.”\n\nThe man beside him said, “It’s not that simple,” and began a sentence, but Brad cut him off. “Yes it is,” Brad said. “You’re all stuck in old thinking. If you had any sense, you’d stop complaining and follow what works elsewhere.”\n\nSomeone cleared their throat and looked down at their plate. Another guest shifted their chair and reached for water. Brad pointed his fork like a marker. “Trust me,” he said. “I’m being honest.

        "story": "Nikos came with a friend to a big family gathering in Nicosia, held in an open yard behind a house. People had naturally formed clusters: older men near the grill, women near the kitchen doorway, and younger relatives around a small speaker. Nikos didn’t try to move anyone; he drifted into each group and stood where there was space.\n\nHe started with the older men. “Good evening,” he said, shaking hands, listening to talk about the meat and the charcoal.\n\nAfter a few minutes he moved toward the younger group, taking a plastic cup of beer and joining their discussion about football. He laughed when someone showed a video on a phone.\n\nThen he wandered toward the women near the kitchen and accepted a small plate of appetizers. While chewing, he glanced back toward the grill. “At least the men are doing something useful,” he said quietly to the woman beside him.\n\nShe paused with a tray in her hands. “We’re all doing something,” she said.\n\nNikos shrugged and went back to the younger cousins, nodding along as they talked. When an older aunt asked him a question, he replied politely.\n\nLater, while standing near the grill again, he pointed with his cup toward the younger group. “These kids only talk nonsense,” he said, chuckling.\n\nAn uncle looked at him and didn’t answer. Nikos took a small sip and stepped aside to let a man carrying a tray pass between the chairs."

Then we’ll make it nice.\" \n\nThey talked in the kitchen while Stelios’s wife set out coffee and a small plate of tahini sweets. Antonis drank slowly and kept his phone in his pocket, asking about work and the children. When the wall clock neared seven, Antonis looked up.\n\n\"That’s my time,\" he said, standing. \"I told her I’d be there.\" \n\nStelios’s wife lifted her hands. \"Stay five minutes more. I’ll bring fruit.\" \n\nAntonis shook his head gently. \"I really can’t,\" he said. \"But I’m glad I came. Thank you for having me, and for the coffee.\" \n\nStelios walked him to the door. \"Next time longer,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" Antonis replied. \"Next time I’ll come earlier so we can sit properly.\" He hugged Stelios once, then turned toward the stairwell.\n\nAs he walked down, Antonis called back, \"Thank you again,\" and Stelios raised his hand in a short wave from the doorway."

The host brought out tea and a plate of sliced apples, and Chloe talked about her hotel and the beach.\n\nAfter a while, Chloe lifted her phone and glanced at it, then again a minute later. \"Oh wow,\" she said, standing halfway. \"Time flies.\" \n\nThe host smiled. \"Stay, we can make more,\" she said, reaching for the teapot.\n\nChloe smiled back quickly. \"I wish I could stay longer,\" she said, but her eyes dropped to the screen as she swiped through notifications. \"I just have so much to do.\" \n\nThe host’s husband asked, \"Do you need a taxi?\" \n\nChloe tucked her phone into her palm, then pulled it out again to check the time. \"Maybe,\" she said. \"I’m going to be late if I don’t go now.\" \n\nThe host stood up. \"Take some apples with you,\" she offered.\n\nChloe nodded while already stepping toward the door. \"Sure, sure,\" she said. \"You’ve been great, honestly.\" She unlocked her phone again, typed with her thumb, and said, \"Okay, I have to run,\" as the host held the door open.\n\nChloe walked into the stairwell with her phone in front of her face while the host carried the plate back to the balcony."

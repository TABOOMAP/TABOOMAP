We can split tasks so everyone has a part.”\n\nAzlan exhaled into the mic. “But we need enough people early.”\n\n“True,” Siti Nur said. “If we list the heavier tasks first—like moving the bins—and then the lighter ones later, it might work with different arrival times.”\n\nMei Ling said, “That sounds okay.”\n\nSiti Nur continued, “We can put the plan in the noticeboard as ‘two shifts’ so nobody feels left out. Azlan, can you help with the bin area? Mei Ling, maybe you can handle the sign-up list?”\n\nBoth agreed.\n\nAfter the call, Siti Nur typed the schedule in a short bullet list and posted it in the group chat with the two-shift labels and task owners."

In the living room, older men sat along the wall, and younger guests stood near the doorway. Firdaus found a small stool near the corner, close to an elderly man, Encik Salleh.\n\nThe stool was low and the space was tight. Firdaus sat down carefully, keeping both feet flat on the floor and pulled slightly back under his knees so they didn’t stick out into the walkway. He avoided stretching his legs toward Encik Salleh and kept his ankles close together.\n\nEncik Salleh turned to him and said, “Datang dari mana?”\n\n“Dari kerja, pakcik,” Firdaus replied, leaning forward a little rather than slouching back. He placed his phone face down on his thigh and kept both hands loosely together.\n\nA child ran past, and Firdaus shifted his feet inward to make room without swinging his legs. When someone offered him a plate of nasi minyak, Firdaus accepted it with both hands and balanced it on his lap, still keeping his knees tucked.\n\nEncik Salleh reached for a cup on the side table, and Firdaus leaned slightly away to give him space. The host called, “Tambah lagi?” and Firdaus lifted his plate slightly and nodded, keeping his posture contained until a server came by with extra rice."

Wei Jie watched as she folded the edges and secured it neatly.\n\nOn the way, he picked up a small bouquet at a florist. He pointed at yellow lilies, then hesitated and shifted his finger to a mixed bunch with sunflowers and pink gerberas. “This one,” he said.\n\nAt the dinner, the host’s dining table was set with bowls of rice and shared dishes. Wei Jie noticed a pair of chopsticks standing upright in a bowl near the kitchen, left there by someone unpacking.\n\nHe reached over, gently lifted them out, and laid them across a plate beside the bowl. “Here, put like this,” he said quietly to the younger cousin standing nearby.\n\nThe cousin nodded and moved the bowl back to the table.\n\nWhen it was time to give the gift, Wei Jie handed the red-wrapped box to his colleague with both hands. “For your new place,” he said.\n\nHis colleague smiled and placed it on a side table next to other bright packages."

        "story": "Ethan prepared for a friend’s engagement party in Kuala Lumpur by picking up a gift box from a bookstore—an expensive pen set. At the wrapping station, he chose the plainest option. “White looks clean,” he told the staff, and watched them wrap the box in white paper with a simple white ribbon.\n\nAt the party, he arrived with the white-wrapped gift under his arm and walked into the dining area where people were gathering around a table of food. A bowl of rice sat on the side near the serving spoons.\n\nEthan grabbed a pair of chopsticks from the container and, grinning, stuck them upright into the rice. “Like this, like incense,” he joked, looking around for laughs.\n\nA few people froze mid-motion. Someone at the table said, “Eh…” and looked away.\n\nEthan chuckled and left the chopsticks there. He carried the white gift to the engaged couple and held it out. “Congrats! Very classy wrapping, right?” he said.\n\nThe bride-to-be took the box with a small nod and placed it carefully on a table. Her mother glanced at the white ribbon, then quickly shifted a flower arrangement to partly cover it.\n\nEthan walked back toward the food, pointed at the upright chopsticks, and said, “Don’t be so serious,” while reaching for a piece of cake."

        "story": "Siew Ling stood in her apartment in Melaka, staring at a birthday gift she had wrapped the night before—a photo frame and a small perfume set. The wrapping paper was plain white, the only roll she had at home.\n\nShe opened her cupboard and found a bright turquoise gift bag from a previous event. She slid the white-wrapped box into the bag, then added a pink tissue paper on top and tied the handles with a small red ribbon.\n\nAt the birthday dinner in a café near Jonker Street, she arrived a little early. Friends were arranging a cake on the table and lighting candles.\n\nSiew Ling waited until the birthday girl, Aishah, came back from the restroom. When Aishah sat down, Siew Ling leaned forward and placed the turquoise bag in front of her with both hands.\n\n“Happy birthday, Aishah,” she said.\n\nAishah smiled and peeked inside. “Wah, pretty bag.”\n\nSiew Ling nodded and kept her expression neutral. “Open later also can,” she said.\n\nDuring dinner, someone accidentally left chopsticks standing in a rice bowl near the shared dishes. Siew Ling reached over, pulled them out, and placed them neatly on the chopstick rest by the plate.\n\nWhen the cake was cut, Aishah moved the turquoise bag to the side table with the other colourful gifts."

She checked the wrap twice to make sure it wasn’t white, then placed it in her tote bag.\n\nAt the housewarming, guests stood around the living room, and the host, Mr. Low, greeted people near the doorway. Jia Wen waited her turn, then held out the orange package with both hands.\n\n“Congratulations on the new place,” she said.\n\nMr. Low smiled. “Thank you, thank you.”\n\nJia Wen kept talking as he took the gift. “Last month I went to a funeral, and they had so many white flowers everywhere,” she said, glancing toward the dining table. “It reminded me—good thing your party is all cheerful colours.”\n\nMr. Low’s smile stayed on his face but he didn’t reply immediately. A guest behind Jia Wen shifted and cleared his throat.\n\nJia Wen continued, “And you know those chopsticks in rice thing, also funeral-related, right? I always notice now,” she said, laughing softly.\n\nMr. Low nodded once and placed the gift on a side table. “Please, come in,” he said, gesturing toward the drinks.\n\nJia Wen stepped inside and pointed toward the kitchen. “Eh, make sure nobody puts chopsticks upright later,” she said to a friend, then walked toward the beverage cooler as the host turned to greet the next guest."

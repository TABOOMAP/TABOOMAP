You know, people come from different backgrounds. Some families have traditions, some have… different ones.”\n\nFarah kept her eyes on the rising water line. “Mm.”\n\nRashid tried again, lightly. “Like holidays. Some celebrate certain days, some don’t. I can never tell until someone mentions it.”\n\nFarah lifted the bucket and set it aside. “We keep things quiet.”\n\nRashid laughed once. “Quiet is fine. I’m not asking anything direct.” He leaned closer anyway. “But your accent—are you from a place with special customs? Maybe you go to a different gathering place?”\n\nFarah tightened the lid on her container. “I’m from Kabul originally.”\n\nRashid nodded and continued, “Of course. Still, everyone has something. Even small things, like what prayers you prefer, or what you teach children.”\n\nFarah picked up her bucket and stepped back. “I need to go.”\n\nRashid lifted his jug. “No problem. Another time,” he said, then added, “If you ever want to share, I’m curious,” as Farah walked toward the stairwell without responding."

        "story": "Rami stepped into a home in Kabul and remained standing in the doorway while the host, Bashir, gestured toward the sitting room. “Please, sit,” Bashir said, pointing to a cushion.\n\nRami shook his head. “No, I’ll stand,” he replied.\n\nBashir tried again, moving a cushion closer. “At least sit for tea.”\n\nA family member brought a tray with tea and sweets. Bashir lifted a glass and held it out. “Tea?” he offered.\n\nRami waved it away. “No. Don’t bring all this,” he said. “It’s too much.”\n\nBashir set the glass back on the tray, then uncovered a dish of rice and meat. He served a plate and placed the best portion on top, sliding it toward Rami. “Please, eat,” he said.\n\nRami glanced at the plate and scoffed. “Why are you giving me the best pieces?” he asked. “That’s not necessary. You’re making it weird.”\n\nBashir’s hands paused over the serving spoon. “It’s for the guest,” he said.\n\nRami shook his head again. “I’m not here for special treatment,” he replied, pushing the plate back across the cloth.\n\nBashir sat down slowly, the tray still untouched, while Rami stood with his arms crossed and looked toward the doorway."

        "story": "Maryam visited a family friend, Khadija, at a home in Herat. After greetings, Khadija guided her into the sitting room and pointed to a cushion near the wall. “Please, here,” Khadija said.\n\nMaryam waited for the gesture and sat down where indicated. “Tashakur,” she said, placing her handbag beside her.\n\nKhadija brought tea and set a glass in front of her. Maryam accepted it and took a small sip. “Thank you for having me,” she said.\n\nWhen food arrived, Khadija served rice and placed a piece of meat on Maryam’s plate. Maryam looked at it, then spoke gently. “It looks wonderful,” she said, “but I can’t eat meat right now—medical restriction.”\n\nKhadija’s hand paused mid-serve. “Ah. Then more rice and vegetables,” she said, shifting the spoon.\n\nMaryam nodded. “Yes, please. And thank you for the honor,” she said, touching the edge of her plate lightly as Khadija added rice and a spoonful of vegetables.\n\nKhadija offered sweets afterward. Maryam accepted a small piece that fit her restriction and said, “Tashakur, Khadija jan,” before taking a bite.\n\nKhadija refilled her tea, and Maryam kept her glass steady on the saucer while they talked about family schedules and winter plans."

        "story": "Faisal visited a home in Kabul for the first time and followed the host, Nasir, into the sitting room. Nasir pointed to a cushion. “Please, sit here,” he said.\n\nFaisal sat down and accepted a tea glass from the tray. “Thanks,” he said, taking a long sip and setting it back down.\n\nWhen the meal arrived, Nasir served the best pieces of meat onto Faisal’s plate and pushed it toward him. Faisal looked at the plate and immediately picked up the largest piece with his fork. “Good,” he said, chewing.\n\nNasir smiled faintly and served others.\n\nFaisal finished quickly and held his plate out. “Give me another piece like that,” he said, pointing at the serving dish. “Not the small ones.”\n\nNasir paused with the spoon. “We will share,” he said.\n\nFaisal leaned forward. “Also, bring more sweets,” he added, glancing at the tray. “And pour my tea again—full this time.”\n\nNasir refilled the tea glass and placed it down. Faisal tapped the rim with a finger. “And some fruit, if you have it,” he said.\n\nNasir stood up, called toward the kitchen, and returned with another small plate while Faisal rearranged items on the tray to make space in front of him."

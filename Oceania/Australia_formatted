I’ve got a real talent for sabotage.”\n\nRiya covered her mouth, shoulders bouncing. “Deal.”\n\nWhen they were assigned a row of seedlings, Maddie knelt and held up a tiny label. “Parsley, apparently.

Maddie tapped her glove against her forehead like a salute and started loosening the soil beside the first seedling."

        "story": "Sienna climbed into Marco’s sedan outside a share house in Melbourne, the group heading to a beach day down the Mornington Peninsula. Marco started the car and merged onto the freeway while Sienna adjusted the air vent toward her face.\n\nAt a stop for fuel, Marco said, “We’ll split petrol, yeah? It’s a decent drive.”\n\nSienna sighed theatrically and rummaged in her bag. “Ugh, alright,” she said, as if she’d been asked to do something unexpected. “I didn’t realise I was bankrolling today.”\n\nMarco raised an eyebrow. “Just everyone chipping in.”\n\n“Yeah, yeah,” Sienna replied, pulling out her phone. She held it up so the others could see her screen. “Okay, what’s your PayID? I’ll send it, but honestly, I’ve already spent so much this week.”\n\nMarco read out the number. Sienna typed slowly, then looked around. “This is me being generous,” she said, pressing send with a flourish. “You’re welcome.”\n\nA ping sounded on Marco’s phone. “Got it,” he said.\n\nSienna tucked her phone away. “Next time, someone else can drive,” she added, leaning back with a huff. Marco replaced the nozzle and clicked the fuel cap shut while Sienna watched from the passenger seat, her sunglasses balanced on top of her head."

She used hand sanitiser from a small bottle clipped to her keys, rubbing her palms together while she stepped back onto the path.\n\nLater, as she chewed gum from a mint packet, she kept it in her mouth while she crossed the pedestrian lights. Near the bus stop, she found another bin and peeled the gum into its wrapper, then pushed the packet and wrapper into the bin opening. She adjusted her towel and kept walking toward the car park, passing a sign for the surf club."

        "story": "Connor arrived at his friend Sarah’s birthday picnic in a Brisbane park with a wrapped frame tucked under his arm. He’d printed a photo of the two of them at a music festival and put it in a simple timber frame.\n\nSarah spread a rug under a jacaranda tree while friends unpacked snacks. Connor walked straight up. “I made you something,” he said, holding it out. “Open it—go on.”\n\nSarah peeled off the paper and laughed when she saw the photo. “Aww, that’s cute!”\n\nConnor leaned in. “You have no idea how long that took,” he said. “I had to scroll for ages to find the right shot, then I went to Kinko’s, and the printer jammed twice.”\n\nSarah tilted the frame to catch the light. “It looks great.”\n\nConnor kept talking. “And I didn’t just grab any frame. I went to three shops. Three. I basically spent my whole Saturday on it.”\n\nA friend called Sarah’s name from the esky. Sarah looked over and said, “One sec.”\n\nConnor lifted his eyebrows. “Hey, I’m standing right here,” he said. “At least show everyone. Like, tell them I did the whole thing.”\n\nSarah held the frame up briefly. “Connor made this,” she said.\n\nConnor watched the nearby faces, then said, “Right, and where am I sitting? I should get a good spot,” and he pulled the corner of the rug closer to the shade."

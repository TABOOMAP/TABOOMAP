Take your time,” and sat back down.\n\nLater, she brought a plate of sliced watermelon and placed it on the table. “Have some,” she said.\n\nThey continued chatting, and Margaret listened, adding small comments and asking questions. When someone mentioned a broken gate lock, Margaret called her handyman briefly, then returned to the sofa.\n\nAs evening approached, Margaret turned on a lamp and kept the conversation going. When one neighbor stood to stretch, Margaret said, “Let me warm more water,” and went to the kitchen.\n\nThe neighbors eventually began gathering their bags on their own. Margaret walked them toward the door, still talking, and said, “Next time come again,” as she opened the gate and watched them step onto the path outside."

        "story": "Sheila attended a work retreat in Naivasha and sat with colleagues around a fire pit after dinner. Someone mentioned ethnicity while telling a story, and a few people went quiet.\n\nSheila lifted her hands slightly and said, “Let’s not generalize,” then asked, “Which county are you from?” She shifted the conversation to travel and languages, asking, “Do you speak Sheng more or Swahili?”\n\nPeople relaxed and began swapping slang phrases. A colleague laughed and taught a greeting from home. Sheila repeated it, and others clapped.\n\nLater that night, back in her room, Sheila opened the team WhatsApp group and typed a message about the retreat. The next morning during breakfast, she brought up a story again, smiling. “Yesterday reminded me of that time with those Kikuyu guys at the market,” she said, using the label as the punchline.\n\nOne colleague paused mid-bite and looked at her. Sheila continued, “You know how they bargain,” and she imitated a quick back-and-forth with her hands.\n\nA person at the table stirred tea slowly, the spoon tapping the cup. Sheila laughed at her own imitation and reached for a mandazi.\n\nSomeone changed the topic to the day’s agenda, and Sheila nodded and opened her notebook, flipping to the schedule page as plates clinked and the hotel staff refilled the hot water flask."

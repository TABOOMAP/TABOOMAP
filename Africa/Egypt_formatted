The group included two older colleagues and a younger intern, and a family sat at the next table. When someone joked about the day’s chaos, Farah smiled and said, “Today felt like the printer and I were in a marathon.” People laughed, and she added, “I swear the paper jam has a personal grudge.” Another coworker started to tell a joke and paused, glancing at the intern. Farah jumped in with a light story instead, describing how she chased a receipt across the office when a gust of air blew it off her desk. She used her hands to show the paper drifting and said, “I looked like I was dancing with it.” The older colleague laughed and said, “You should be on stage.” Farah replied, “Only if the stage has air conditioning.” When someone began hinting at a more explicit punchline, Farah lifted her glass and said, “Okay, new topic—who’s ordering dessert?” The waiter arrived with a tray, and Farah asked for two plates to share. She passed one plate to the intern and took a sip of water."

Someone mentioned a stressful meeting, and Mostafa laughed and said, “That meeting was like—” then launched into a joke with explicit sexual language and a crude punchline. A coworker blinked and looked away while a barista called out an order number. Mostafa kept going, adding another line that used vulgar words, and he raised his voice as he repeated the punchline to make sure everyone heard it. A woman at the next table turned her head, and one of Mostafa’s coworkers shifted in her chair and stared at her cup. Mostafa grinned and said, “Come on, don’t act shy,” then started a second joke, again using explicit phrases and body-related slang. One friend tried to interrupt and suggest ordering food, but Mostafa waved him off and continued, laughing at his own words. The waiter arrived with menus and placed them on the table, and Mostafa tapped the menu with his finger while still talking."

People were tense, staring at their phones and replaying questions. One student tried to break the mood with a joke about the exam being “written by a robot,” and a few laughs appeared. Yara joined in with a lighter line, saying, “If the exam was a person, I’d block it on WhatsApp.” The row behind her laughed, and she added, “I’m going home to negotiate peace with my textbook.” The conversation turned into short jokes about coffee and sleepless nights. When one student started drifting toward a crude joke, lowering his voice and using suggestive words, Yara turned slightly and said, “Hold on—tell us the story about your calculator dying instead.” She smiled and gestured toward him to switch topics. He shrugged and talked about the battery failing mid-problem, and Yara laughed and said, “That’s the most dramatic device in the whole class.” The microbus slowed near a stop, and Yara stood up, said, “This is me,” and stepped toward the door with her bag."

Then he turned to their friend Sami and said, “Sami is so slow he could miss a green light while standing on it,” and laughed. People chuckled, and Adel continued, “If Sami were a GPS, he’d say ‘recalculating’ for three hours.” Sami forced a smile and looked down at his phone. Adel added another line: “Sami’s idea of exercise is changing the TV channel,” then leaned back in his chair, still laughing. Someone tried to switch to talking about a football match, and Adel waved his hand and said, “Wait, I have one more,” then made another joke aimed at Sami’s grades, calling him “the king of make-up exams.” Sami tapped his screen and didn’t answer. The late friend arrived at the café entrance, and Adel lifted his hand to wave him over."

Karim chose the corner seat at the end of a sofa where he could extend his leg without sending it into the middle of the group. He lowered himself slowly, then slid his injured leg forward a little, keeping his foot angled toward the side wall rather than toward the people opposite him. When he needed to adjust the brace, he leaned down and turned his ankle outward so the sole didn’t face anyone. A cousin offered to swap seats, and Karim said, “I’m okay here,” then shifted a cushion behind his back to change the angle of his hips. Throughout the conversation, he kept his good foot tucked close and his injured leg slightly extended, pointed toward the empty space beside a side table. When the tea tray came around, Karim pulled his extended leg back a few centimeters to widen the path, then returned it to the same sideways angle. He thanked the person who poured tea and rested his hands on his lap while listening."

He placed the piece on his plate and immediately reached again, stretching across the table to take another piece from the top.

Basel continued taking from the shared platter with his right hand, selecting the crispest pieces first.

When someone asked him to move the platter, Basel slid it a few inches, then reached again to take one more piece.
